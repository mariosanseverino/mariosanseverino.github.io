                    I was born on May 25th of 1993, in Porto Alegre/BRA. From birth, connected to arts, despite beign a logical problem solver and a technology lover.
                    Always happy when healthy and enjoying free time having fun skateboarding, playing videogames and meeting his friends for a drink.
                    Graduated with a bachelor&apos;s degree in Business Management in 2018.
                    During my life, I worked not only as a Graphic Designer and as Paid Marketing Campaing Analyst, but also as a Tattoo Artist.
                    Lived in Sydney/AUS from 2018 to 2020 to experience life far from his home country.
					In Sydney, I have got my first real one. And from there, I just did not stop.
