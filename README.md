Mario's portfolio is under a forever enduring construction and updating. In this repository, you can find my portfolio with drawings and Web Development projects. The proposition is to share my work and leave a digital footprint of what I can do.

This project was first designed for desktop, the mobile version is still to be developed, anytime soon. The stack used here was NextJS, TypeScript and Tailwind CSS mainly.
It is possible to access the latest version here:
