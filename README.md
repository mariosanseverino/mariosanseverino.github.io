Mario's tattoo drawing library is under a forever enduring construction and updating. In this repository, you can find my portfolio with drawings and tattoos already done.

The stack used here was NextJS, TypeScript and Tailwind CSS mainly.
It is possible to access the deployment here:

Clicking the logo switch the page between dark and light mode. Also, clicking the images in the home page, expand the drawings.
